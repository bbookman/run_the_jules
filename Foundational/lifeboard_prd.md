## Product Overview

**Product Name:** Lifeboard  
**Core Vision:** An interactive reflection space and powerful planning assistant where there is infinite opportunity for discovery and planning, transforming each day into a personal newspaper through automated ingestion of digital life data, organized around the fundamental dimensions of when and where.

### Primary Value Proposition
Lifeboard helps people discover patterns and insights in their own life data they wouldn't see otherwise, by organizing experiences around the critical dimensions of when and where they happened.

### Key Differentiators
- AI-powered life exploration through chat interface
- Calendar-centric "scroll through your life" interface
- Automation-first data ingestion (minimal manual input)
- Open source from launch with local-first deployment
- Rich preservation of native data formats while enabling unified views

## Target Users

### Primary User (MVP)
**Technical users** comfortable with command line installation, Docker, and configuration files. These users value:
- Privacy and local data control
- Ability to customize and extend the system
- Rich, detailed access to their digital life data
- Tools for life reflection and pattern discovery

### Secondary Users (Roadmap)
- People seeking clarity and insight
- Digital wellness enthusiasts
- Creative individuals seeking inspiration from experiences
- Busy professionals seeking better life organization
- General consumers (via simple installer and cloud service)

## Core Problem Statement

Most people generate vast amounts of digital data across platforms but lack tools to:
1. Automatically aggregate this data in meaningful ways
2. Discover patterns and insights they wouldn't notice manually
3. Use their life data for reflection and future planning
4. Create a comprehensive, searchable record of their lived experience organized by when and where events occurred

This is especially critical for individuals concerned about memory preservation and those navigating major life transitions.

## MVP Features

6. **AI interaction:** Floating chat widget allows conversational exploration of life data

## Design Philosophy

### Cost-Conscious Architecture
Lifeboard prioritizes **free and open source dependencies** wherever possible to ensure accessibility and long-term sustainability. The system is designed to minimize operational costs while maximizing functionality:
- **Local-first processing** reduces cloud API dependencies and ongoing costs
- **Open source core libraries** for data processing, storage, and interface components
- **Optional premium integrations** for users who choose enhanced AI capabilities
- **Self-hosted deployment** eliminates recurring service fees

### Hybrid AI and Traditional Approaches
Rather than relying exclusively on large language models, Lifeboard leverages a **balanced approach** combining AI with proven traditional methods:
- **Text processing**: Statistical keyword extraction and pattern matching provide reliable categorization, enhanced by AI for semantic understanding and context
- **Data analysis**: Rule-based trend detection and aggregation ensure consistent performance, with AI adding interpretive insights
- **Search functionality**: Traditional database queries for precise matching, complemented by vector similarity for semantic exploration
- **Content generation**: Template-based summaries guarantee baseline functionality, enriched by AI for personalized narrative style
- **Graceful degradation**: Core features remain functional when AI services are unavailable or rate-limited

### Extreme Modularity and Future-Proofing
Every component is designed for **seamless replacement** without system-wide changes:
- **Pluggable AI backends** - swap between mem0, LangChain, or custom implementations via configuration
- **Database flexibility** - migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL without application code changes
- **Processing pipeline modularity** - mix and match data processing approaches based on performance and accuracy needs
- **Interface adaptability** - support multiple frontend approaches while maintaining consistent APIs

### Accessibility Through Abstraction
Complex technical implementations are hidden behind **simple, consistent interfaces**:
- **Configuration-driven complexity** - advanced features accessible through simple settings
- **Sensible defaults** for all components to minimize required setup
- **Progressive disclosure** - basic functionality works immediately, advanced features available when needed
- **Clear separation of concerns** ensuring each component has a single, well-defined responsibility

This philosophy ensures Lifeboard remains **accessible, affordable, and adaptable** while providing a robust foundation for life data exploration and insight generation.

## Architecture Principles

### Modular Plugin Architecture
Lifeboard is designed as a **composable system** where core components can be swapped without system rebuild or extensive code changes. This principle drives all technical decisions and ensures long-term adaptability.

#### Core Abstraction Layers
- **Data Storage Layer:** Abstracted interface supporting multiple backends (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- **Vector Store Layer:** Pluggable semantic search backends (for "chat with your life" functionality)
- **AI/Memory Layer:** Pluggable AI systems (mem0, LangChain, custom implementations)
- **Data Connector Layer:** Standardized interface for adding new data sources
- **Module System:** Hot-swappable UI modules with consistent APIs
- **Processing Pipeline:** Configurable data processing with interchangeable components

#### Design Requirements
- **Zero-conflict development:** Architecture changes should not create merge conflicts
- **Runtime swapping:** Components can be changed via configuration without code modification
- **Clean interfaces:** Well-defined APIs between all system layers
- **Community extensibility:** Third-party developers can add modules without touching core code
- **Future-proofing:** System adapts to new technologies and data sources gracefully

#### Implementation Standards
- **Dependency injection** for all major components
- **Interface-driven design** with concrete implementations behind abstractions
- **Configuration-based wiring** of system components
- **Standardized plugin discovery** and loading mechanisms
- **Comprehensive adapter patterns** for external integrations

This modular approach ensures Lifeboard can evolve with changing technology landscapes while maintaining stability for users and developers.

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Database Design
- **Specialized tables approach** chosen over flexible document storage
- **Rationale:** Calendar view performance is critical; date-based queries need optimization
- **Structure:** Separate tables for each data source with shared metadata/tagging layer
- **Primary indexing:** Optimized for date + location queries to support both temporal and spatial life exploration
- **Complementary search architecture:** Traditional database queries for structured data + vector store layer for semantic exploration and "chat with your life" functionality

### Data Processing
- **Hybrid approach:** Real-time processing for time-sensitive data, batch processing for historical data
- **Native format preservation:** Full rich data maintained with lightweight tagging overlay
- **Performance priority:** Calendar "daily newspaper" view drives architectural decisions, with database design anticipating future location-based exploration patterns

### AI Integration
- **Local processing** preferred where possible (aligns with privacy-first approach)
- **Extensible prompting system** foundation for future customization features
